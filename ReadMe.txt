This Project build on Windows system
I build sveral class to store different items.
Class player extends from heros
Class Spirit and dragon extends from Monster
Store used to display store and buy item  
Skill for Magic spells
And those Weaponry Exoskeletons Armory used for store info for hero items.

This game is still unbalanced, our hero can easily be killed by monsters, which need to fixed in the future.
